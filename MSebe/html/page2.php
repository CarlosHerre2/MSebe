		<h2>When did I start?</h3>
		<blockquote>
			From My Early Ages My Life journey was not a straight path but more like a search for True Satisfaction in the “work or Career Path” I would choose. My search for True Satisfaction took shape at the age of 16 through music. The Late Jay Hlongwane, a Multi Millionaire Musician/Business Man who owned a Media & Sound Engineering Company, inspired me. I then relocated to Johannesburg to pursue a career in Information Technology with C.T.U Training Institute. I completed my Hardware Diploma but wanted to further my career with Computer Programming, so I began to fix and Refurbish Old and damaged Computers for extra Money in order to pay for my Studies at C.T.I Education Group. ”Best investment I have ever made”.
